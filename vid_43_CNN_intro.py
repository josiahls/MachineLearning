CNN THEORY:

Everyhting startsfromthe concept of a neuron.
It is conposed of dendrits which go to the neuron,
and the axon which outputs to another denarites.
the connection between these is the synapse

Neural network doesnt actually use any of these term tehe
So if the neoron gets a set of inputs, each one has its definition of
what makes it fire.

SO you might have something like:
x1 -> weight1 ->
x2 -> weight2 -> sum(x1,x2,x3) -> f(step function that has a limit to make it fire (1))
x3 -> weight3 ->
